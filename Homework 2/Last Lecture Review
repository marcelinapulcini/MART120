Last Lecture

My mother has always called me her "glass half empty kid". Since I was small, the chicken little motif rang true though all of my doings and sayings. It's pretty apropos considering my last name means "Little Chickens". 

More recently, my inability to find joy in things has made me feel incredibly uncomfortable, in all aspects of my life. My relationship is suffering, my work is sloppy and inconsistent, my friendships are strained and I feel drained just waking up in the morning.

Honestly, I wasn't always this way. There was a time where nothing could stop me- I was determined and strong willed to make something of myself. Eventually that landed me here- 30 years old, finally going back to school after dropping out at 19 years old due to a severe drug and alcohol problem. I am one of the fortunate. I was lucky enough to get sober at 23 years old and have maintained that throughout the last 7 and a half years. But there's still this trepidation in my heart, like I am undeserving of the joy that life can bring due to my past failings.

While watching the Last Lecture, Randy Pausch called me out in the kindest way possible. He called out my insecurities, my inhibitions and my doubts. It's actually incredibly ironic as I was called out at work for being unwilling and not open when receiving feedback. The largest element that stood out to me was the concept of "Don't me a jerk- it's only limiting your possibilities".

I think this statement not only applies to being rude to other but being a jerk to yourself. For years, my inner dialogue has been nothing but rude, degrading, and mean-spirited feedback. No wonder I can't receive it from others! The feedback I give myself is harmful and hurtful. Watching Last Lecture was a large wakeup call for me- giving me the idea to let it go. Let go of bullying myself and finally give myself the break I deserve to succeed. 

I hope to live the rest of my life the way Randy did his: full of child-like wonder and joy.
