        I started creating custom pieces of different women to help myself understand my own feminity more. 
        <div id="myid">While it's been really hard during quarantine to feel connected to that part of myself, doing my artwork helps.</div>
        After years of not feeling pretty or beautiful, it finally dawned on me that to find that part of myself, I have to also be able to see it in others.
        <div>As time as gone on, I have seen the beauty in all women and their abilties to overcome adversity through strength, braveness, and love.
            This year has been a testament to bold women and how they can affect real change in our world.</div>
