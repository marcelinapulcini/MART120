    <p>I started creating custom pieces of different women to help myself understand my own feminity more. 
        While it's been really hard during quarantine to feel connected to that part of myself, doing my artwork helps.
        After years of not feeling pretty or beautiful, it finally dawned on me that to find that part of myself, I have to also be able to see it in others.
        As time as gone on, I have seen the beauty in all women and their abilties to overcome adversity through strength, braveness, and love.
        This year has been a testament to bold women and how they can affect real change in our world.
