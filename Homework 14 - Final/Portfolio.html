    <h3>Homework 4</h3>

    <p>This studio code drawing was super fun to make. While it's the only screenshot I could find of my work, it was
        really cool to be able to start coding in this way because it made it less intimidating.
    </p>

    <h3>Homework 9</h3>

    <p>My first Pj5 drawing of myself- super fun to work through and figure out and made coding easier to understand.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Homework 10</h3>

    <p>The same drawing but we added movement and while the movement of my arms didn't work super great, it actually was really cool
        what happened.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Homework 11</h3>

    <p>Next, we went into our Pj5 game and it was really fun to try and figure out even though it was a simple game it was still complicated.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Homework 12</h3>
    <img src=homework_12.png height='200' width='200'/>
    <p>This got more complicated as we added functions into the game and that made things easier to organize but was also complicated. It was
        still fun though!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Homework 13</h3>
    <img src=homework_13.png height='200' width='200'/>
    <p>Finally, we added arrays into our game and that made it even more complicated. I don't fully understand arrays and I needed Michael's help, it
        was still fun to learn.
